                <a href="project.html"><image class="projects-image" src="project 1.jpg" alt="C.Turtle Data Entry App Logo"/></a>
                
                <p>Created an app to track turtle nestings on the beaches in Gabon. Tailored to the group's needs: its user interface is high contrast for use in direct sunlight. Data can ve collected offline and uploaded later when the user has an internet connection. Maps nests trough their GPS locations and shows countdown to expected hatching date.</p>

                <img class="projects-image" src="project 2.png"/>
                <p>For the final project in CS211, I created a replica of Pacman using GE211, a graphics library in C++. The game functions like the original game. Using a keyboard to operate the game, the user moves Pacman around the maze using the arrow keys as they are the most intuitive directional keys. Pacman starts off moving until he reaches a wall to show the user that Pacman can move and can be steered. Although visual design was simplified, it was made to resemble the user's expectations of the original arcade game. I asked a friend to test the controls and was able to use it.</p>
