                <h2>C.Turtle Data Entry App for Sea Turtle Monitoring</h2>
                
                <p>Research: I was interested in the turtle conservation effort on the beaches of Libreville. Volunteers would walk the beach every morning and report the locations of new nests on the beach in a WhatsApp chat. Someone would then go through the chat and transfer the information into an Excel sheet and Google Drive folders. This method being rather inefficient, I sought to make a way to gather data more conveniently by using smartphones. iOS was chosen because most volunteers had iPhones. Using their phones, volunteers would record a nest, take pictures that would automatically be geotagged, and uploaded to Google's FireBase and mapped (click below to see more) so that volunteers would know when and where hatchings were due to occur and could address potential problems proactively.</p>
